1-3 lines description of what classes have been added or updated and what functionality have been implemented in them (even if they were not ready yet).
What methods / functionality have been tested so far in classes so that they work properly?
What possibly difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?
What has been the workload used during this time with some 5 hours accuracy.
Whether you are ahead or lagging behind what you presented in the project plan (roughly at this phase).




I have implement some basic GUI components. I  think it works well because I usually run the GUI after implemeting
new component to check whether it works well or not.
I am also thinking of way to construct my code so that I can keep track of everything in the app.
Because the app may have many boards, I have to have an UI Class for boards to keep track all the cards in that board in
GUI. But I now still focus more on implementing the drag n drop.

I have attended 2 exercise sessions to solve my difficulties during those weeks. I am now having some
problems with my fileParsing. I have written the code but it can't run so I don't know whether it works
well or not.

The workload was about 20 hours.
I think I am on the right track. I am trying to get an idea of drag and drop and implement it during this
week so I can join next Monday session in case I face some difficulties with drag n drop.
