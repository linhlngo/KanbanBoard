1-3 lines description of what classes have been added or updated and what functionality have been implemented in them (even if they were not ready yet).
What methods / functionality have been tested so far in classes so that they work properly?
What possibly difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?
What has been the workload used during this time with some 5 hours accuracy.
Whether you are ahead or lagging behind what you presented in the project plan (roughly at this phase).


Some methods in GUI have been added, including search cards by tag and name, delete / add cards/boards, time tracking for
the cards ( with the input is the day chosen on the calendar by the user, and then the days remaining to the deadline will
be calculated and shown). One method still be missing from the GUI is archive and return cards. I planned to finish it
at the end of this week. There is still a minor problem with search cards, otherwise other functions work well.


Somehow, I have managed to get the drag and drop works ( the card can be transferred between 3 columns). I create the
cardID and then put it in the dragboard content. Then, I will get the content of the board
 ( with the help of another methods search by id ). It works well but if two cards have the same name, there is a problem
 with it. I am thinking of ways to solve it.

The workload used is about 20 hours. I think I am on the right track. Next week is for IO file and revising the code
again. Then the last week is for documentation ( I hope so).
