1-3 lines description of what classes have been added or updated and what functionality have been implemented in them (even if they were not ready yet).
What methods / functionality have been tested so far in classes so that they work properly?
What possibly difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?
What has been the workload used during this time with some 5 hours accuracy.
Whether you are ahead or lagging behind what you presented in the project plan (roughly at this phase).




The classes Board, Card, and KanbanBoard have been added with some basic functionalities such as remove/add card/board, edit card, return/archive card, filter by tag.
I think I will only need to implement the time-tracking function to make it complete.

I have tested functionality of all methods I have implemented in the folder Test.

Some difficulties for me are about the GUi parts. I have no experience in GUI before so I have to research a lot 
and I have no idea where to start.  

The workload is about 20 hours.


I think I am at the right point in my project plan. I plan to finish the basic GUI at the end of this month.
